# Progress: conjure-lite

## âœ… Completed Features

### Core Infrastructure
- Project setup: Monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- Build system: tsup with dual ESM/CommonJS output
- TypeScript: Strict configuration with comprehensive typing
- Testing: Vitest with coverage reporting
- Linting: ESLint + dprint with modern configurations
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions pipeline

### Schema System
- Base Conjure schemas: Complete Zod-based definitions
- Conjure Plus extension: x-tags metadata support
- Namespaced type support: Extended ConjureType for cross-file imports
- Schema validation: Runtime validation capabilities
- Extension pattern: Clean schema extension without duplication

### YAML to IR Processing (COMPLETED)
- conjure-imports implementation: Full cross-file type reference support
- Two-phase architecture: File loading â†’ type registry â†’ IR generation
- Global context management: Circular import prevention
- Namespaced type resolution: `namespace.TypeName` syntax support
- File-based processing: `conjureYamlToIrFromFile()` with path resolution
- Test coverage: Comprehensive tests for imports, x-tags, external types

### Code Generation Architecture
- Base generator: Abstract `BaseFileGenerator` class
- Generator pattern: Modular architecture
- Template system: `dedent`-based generation
- File management: Utilities for organized output

### CLI & Runtime
- CLI foundation: yargs-based with generate subcommand
- Runtime support: `ConjureContext`, `conjureFetch` (basic)
- Example projects: Widget example with working generated code

### Monorepo Management (ENHANCED - COMPLETED)
- Monorepolint integration: v0.6.0-alpha.5 with archetype-based configuration
- Archetype system: Package types defined with shared configurations
  - `publishedLibraries`: @conjure-lite/cli, conjure-lite (full build/test/API checking)
  - `configPackages`: @conjure-lite/tsconfig (minimal config-only packages)
  - `examplePackages`: conjure-lite.example (private with build/test)
  - `rootPackage`: conjure-lite-repo (workspace root with special handling)
- Package consistency: Automatic field ordering, dependency alignment
- Turbo integration: Monorepo checks in CI/CD pipeline
- Scripts: `pnpm check:monorepo` and `pnpm fix:monorepo` commands
- Advanced rules: Conditional dependencies, exports structure, publishConfig

### TypeScript Configuration (NEW - COMPLETED)
- Updated all tsconfig files to use `${configDir}` template variable (TypeScript 5.5+)
- Improved path resolution for shared base configurations
- Enhanced portability of configuration files across projects
- All builds and compilation working correctly with new template variables

## ðŸ”„ Remaining Work

### Code Generation Completion
- Complete file generators: Endpoint, Service, Components, Package
- Index generation: Automatic barrel exports
- Advanced features: Zod schemas, custom headers, error mapping

### Testing & Quality
- Comprehensive unit/integration tests
- Snapshot testing for generated code
- Performance testing for large APIs
- Error scenario handling

### Documentation & DX
- Complete API reference and CLI documentation
- Schema extension guide for Conjure Plus
- Better error messages with context
- Progress indicators and debug mode

## Current Status
- **Overall**: ~60% complete (infrastructure and architecture done)
- **Code Generation**: ~40% (architecture complete, implementation in progress)
- **Testing**: ~30% (basic tests, need comprehensive coverage)
- **Documentation**: ~20% (basic examples, need full docs)

## Known Limitations
1. Incomplete file generators
2. Limited error handling
3. Performance untested for large APIs
4. Documentation gaps
5. No plugin system (architecture supports it)

## Success Metrics
- âœ… Generated code compiles without TypeScript errors
- âœ… Full type safety in generated clients
- âœ… Easy installation process
- ðŸ”„ Fast generation (<30s for large APIs)
- ðŸ”„ Clear documentation and error messages
- ðŸ”„ Community adoption and contribution

## Next Milestones
1. **Core Generation Complete** (2 weeks): All generators, basic error handling
2. **Production Ready** (4 weeks): Comprehensive tests, performance optimization
3. **Advanced Features** (8 weeks): Zod schemas, plugin architecture
4. **Ecosystem Integration** (12 weeks): IDE extensions, stable 1.0 release
