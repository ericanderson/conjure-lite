# Cline's Memory Bank

My memory resets completely between sessions. I rely ENTIRELY on the Memory Bank to understand projects and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task.

## Memory Bank Structure

Core files in Markdown format with clear hierarchy:

```
projectbrief.md (foundation)
├── productContext.md (why/what)
├── systemPatterns.md (architecture)  
└── techContext.md (technology)
    └── activeContext.md (current focus)
        └── progress.md (status)
```

### Core Files
1. **projectbrief.md** - Foundation document, core requirements, project scope
2. **productContext.md** - Project purpose, problems solved, user experience goals
3. **activeContext.md** - Current work focus, recent changes, next steps, key patterns
4. **systemPatterns.md** - Architecture, technical decisions, design patterns, component relationships
5. **techContext.md** - Technology stack, development setup, constraints, dependencies
6. **progress.md** - Completed work, remaining tasks, current status, known issues

### Additional Context
Create supplementary files for:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications  
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Workflows

**Plan Mode**: Read Memory Bank → Verify completeness → Develop strategy → Present approach

**Act Mode**: Check Memory Bank → Update documentation → Execute task → Document changes

## Documentation Updates

Update Memory Bank when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. User requests **update memory bank** (review ALL files)
4. Context needs clarification

When triggered by **update memory bank**, review every file focusing on activeContext.md and progress.md for current state.

## Optimization Principles

**Content Guidelines:**
- Eliminate redundancy across files
- Use bullet points over paragraphs
- Maintain hierarchical structure (general → specific)
- Focus on actionable development information
- Aim for 60-80% token reduction while preserving critical details

**File Optimization:**
- **projectbrief.md**: Ultra-concise purpose, goals, scope
- **productContext.md**: Essential context only
- **activeContext.md**: Detailed but focused current work
- **systemPatterns.md**: Key architectural decisions only
- **techContext.md**: Condensed technical essentials
- **progress.md**: Streamlined status tracking

The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work and must be maintained with precision and clarity for maximum effectiveness.
